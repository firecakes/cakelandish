## What is this?

It's a powerful, self-hosted blogging server with RSS reading + writing support and written in Deno.

## Why did you make this?

- I'm tired of people and their data being reliant on social media corporations
- I'm tired of relying on Webpack
- More people should learn and use RSS
- I've yet to see an existing blogging platform/framework that caters to my
  wants
- I want to make the easiest server for non-programmers to host their own
  content with
